# pyaromatics

This is a collection of tools I use for several of my projects, but could be helpful for somebody else. Some are functions that I've written from scratch, 
but many are collected from other projects, but it was helpful for me to have them centralized. If they were collected from another project, the original
is referenced close to the function or at the beginning of the script. If I forgot to reference any that was not mine, let me know! The author has to be recognized.

It can be installed by 

```pip install pyaromatics```
